### Technical Requirements 
- Use Flexbox and / or Grid in your CSS to achieve a multi-column layout. 
- Follow the design guidelines established in the [specs](design-specs.md)
- Using CSS, make your page look as similar as you can to the design file. The HTML and content have been provided for you.
